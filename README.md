## About
This website is designed to make the best of your day by creating a schedule. There are 9 slots for each hour of the typical 9-5 work day. The past is shown in a tan color, the present is shown in a teal color, and the future is shown in a purple color. You are able to input text and save it for further referencing throughout the day. When your day is finished, you can clear your schedule and start over for the next day.

2. Click on the designated text box for the hour you would like to schedule.
3. Type in your tasks for that sepecific hour.
4. Click on the save button on the right of each hour.
5. Close the page if you wish and come back to reference later.
6. After all tasks are complete, press the clear button at the bottom to start over.
